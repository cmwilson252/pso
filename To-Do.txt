-Alter the front page like we talked about with that screenshot(shrink, move things up, take off bottom portion, move links up)
-Add a link for Quests on the links portion
-Add a link for Player Cards on the link portion
-Move over to semantics(? up to you really, I like it)
-Maybe more design things like adding back ground images that run down the side perhaps similar to the way ultima has it.
-Is it possible to Add little pictures of the class on the Character Breakdown section to the right of class name?
-Send you more money $$$$$
